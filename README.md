# AI-Powered Resume Screening System

This project presents an AI-powered Resume Screening System designed to automate and enhance the candidate evaluation process. The application uses a Generative AI–driven agentic approach to analyze resumes and extract meaningful insights that support intelligent hiring decisions.

---

## Introduction

Manual resume screening is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. This system addresses those challenges by applying Generative AI techniques to understand, analyze, and evaluate resumes in a structured and scalable manner. The application provides an efficient mechanism for resume ingestion, interpretation, and candidate assessment.

---

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular client–server architecture consisting of:

- **Backend Layer**: Responsible for resume ingestion, text extraction, and AI-based analysis.
- **Frontend Layer**: Provides an interactive interface for uploading resumes and viewing screening results.
- **AI Agent Layer**: Executes intelligent resume understanding using Generative AI models.

Each layer is independently scalable and loosely coupled to support future enhancements.

## Backend Overview

The backend is developed using Python and FastAPI. It handles:
- Resume upload and validation
- PDF text extraction and preprocessing
- Communication with AI agents
- Aggregation of extracted resume insights

The backend acts as the core processing unit of the system.

---

## Frontend Overview

The frontend is built using Streamlit and serves as the user interaction layer. It allows users to:
- Upload resumes in PDF format
- Trigger AI-based screening workflows
- View structured candidate evaluation results

The frontend communicates seamlessly with the backend through RESTful APIs.

---

## AI Agentic Approach

The system adopts an agentic AI approach where specialized agents perform distinct tasks such as:
- Resume content understanding
- Skill and experience extraction
- Contextual interpretation of candidate profiles

Generative AI models enable semantic understanding beyond keyword matching, producing more accurate and meaningful evaluations.

---

## Generative AI Integration

Generative AI plays a critical role in transforming unstructured resume data into structured insights. The models are used to:
- Interpret resume content contextually
- Extract relevant professional information
- Assist in candidate suitability analysis

This approach improves screening quality compared to traditional rule-based systems.

---

## Key Capabilities

- Automated resume screening
- Intelligent information extraction
- Context-aware candidate evaluation
- Scalable and modular system design
- Reduced manual effort in hiring workflows

---

## Use Cases

- HR resume shortlisting
- Recruitment automation
- Candidate profiling
- AI-assisted hiring support systems

---

## Conclusion

The AI-Powered Resume Screening System demonstrates how Generative AI and agentic architectures can significantly improve recruitment processes. By combining backend intelligence with an intuitive frontend, the system delivers efficient, consistent, and scalable resume screening suitable for modern hiring needs.
